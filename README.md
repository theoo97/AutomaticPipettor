# Automatic Pipettor

This project implements an automatic pipettor system. It uses
the ATMEGA324 microcontroller to control the mechanical systems
and a mobile application as the user interface.

## Structure
ATMEGA324 directory contains the code base for the microcontroller.
ControlPanel directory contains the code base for the mobile app.
